				<p>TThe 2024 international football scene has been highlighted by spectacular performances from some of the world's most talented players in both Euro 2024 and Copa America. In Euro 2024, England's Harry Kane has been a standout, demonstrating his exceptional goal-scoring prowess and leadership on the pitch, which has been crucial in propelling his team to the finals. Spain's young sensation, Pedri, has also captivated audiences with his remarkable vision and playmaking skills, proving to be a vital asset for his team. Meanwhile, in Copa America, Argentina's Lionel Messi has once again showcased his legendary status with dazzling dribbles, precise free-kicks, and decisive contributions that have been pivotal for his national team. Brazil's Neymar has equally impressed, bringing his trademark flair, speed, and creativity to the tournament, leading his team through challenging matches. These players have not only entertained fans with their extraordinary abilities but have also significantly contributed to the success of their respective teams in these prestigious competitions.</p>

			<p>With the Finals for both the competitions approaching, it is going to be interesting to see which countries will be lifting the trophies in their respective competitions. Will the Messi led Argentina be able to get a back-to-back win in the finals, or will the James Rodriguez led Colombia, finally be able to lift the trophy after 21 long years. On the Euro Cup, will the three lions be able to get their hands on the UEFA trophy for the first time ever, or will Spain get it back. Stay Tuned !!</p>
